## Description
Project 2 - As we enter the last phase of the bootcamp we will want to display collaboration efforts that show not only do we know how to work independently but also collaborate with others. For this project groups are tasked with using everything we have learned over the past six weeks and create a real-world full-stack application that we can showcase to any potential employer. 

## Project Requirements

Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine.
Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed.
Have a polished UI.
Be responsive.
Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.
Include authentication (express-session and cookies).
Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

Finally, you must add your project to the portfolio that you created in Module 2.

## User Story
As A developer who creates full-stack web applications, I WANT a web application that will allow users to view job postings based on keywords after they have signed into the site, and allow employers to post new job reqs.

## Acceptance Criteria
